# Triton Translator

TritonTranslator is a standalone static IR translation framework, using semantics extracted from Triton. It offers:
- Full support for x86 and x86_64
- AST and three address code representations of x86_64
- Instruction semantics 

You can find an example usage [here](https://github.com/Colton1skees/TritonTranslator/blob/master/TritonTranslator.Examples/Program.cs).

# Roadmap
 * [x] AST representation of x86 and x86_64
 * [x] Three address code representation of x86 and x86_64
